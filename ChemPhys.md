Chemometrics and computational physics are concerned with the analysis
of data arising in chemistry and physics experiments, as well as the
simulation of physico-chemico systems. Many of the functions in base R
are useful for these ends.

The second edition of *Chemometrics with R: Multivariate Data Analysis
in the Natural and Life Sciences* by Ron Wehrens, ISBN
978-3-662-62027-4, Springer, 2020, provides an introduction to
multivariate statistics in the life sciences, as well as coverage of
several specific topics from the area of chemometrics. The associated
package `r github("rwehrens/ChemometricsWithR")` facilitates
reproduction of the examples in the book.

The book *Modern Statistical Methods for Astronomy With R Applications*
by Eric D. Feigelson and G. Jogesh Babu, ISBN-13: 9780521767279,
Cambridge, 2012, provides an introduction to statistics for astronomers
and an overview of the foremost methods being used in astrostatistical
analysis, illustrated by examples in R.

The book by Kurt Varmuza and Peter Filzmoser, *Introduction to
Multivariate Statistical Analysis in Chemometrics,* ISBN
978-1-420-05947-2, CRC Press, 2009, is associated with the package
`r pkg("chemometrics")`.

A special issue of R News with a focus on [R in
Chemistry](http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2006-3.pdf) was
published in August 2006. A special volume of Journal of Statistical
Software (JSS) dedicated to [Spectroscopy and Chemometrics in
R](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v18/) was published in January 2007.

    means of constraining `x` to non-negative or non-positive values;
    the package `r pkg("bvls")` allows other bounds on `x`
    to be applied.
-   Functions for isotonic regression are available in the package
    `r pkg("Iso", priority = "core")`, and are useful to
    determine the unimodal vector that is closest to a given vector `x`
    under least squares criteria.

    of the `r pkg("nlme")` package.
